# UniStep

Built with React and Tailwind, the app features a clean and minimalist interface that allows you to input a single task and then hides the input field until you've completed the task at hand. Once you finish the task, the input field reappears, allowing you to add a new one. This approach helps you stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed by a long list of tasks. Whether you're working on a big project or just need to tackle a few to-dos, UniStep makes it easy to take things one step at a time.
